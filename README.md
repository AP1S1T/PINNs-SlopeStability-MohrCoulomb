# PINNs-SlopeStability-MohrCoulomb
This repository implements Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for slope stability analysis based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The aim is to evaluate slope stability under various conditions, providing insights into critical parameters such as safety factors, displacement, and stress distribution.
